<h1>Title: </h1>

    <article>
        <p>There are many published opinions on the value of IT certifications when you‚Äôre looking for a job. If you do a web search, you‚Äôll find ‚Äôem. They range from ‚Äúit depends on the certification‚Äù to ‚Äúthey‚Äôre absolutely essential‚Äù. Well, I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb here and say that certifications are nearly worthless.</p>
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown">Those who write about IT certification usually have something at stake. Either there‚Äôs a financial incentive or they want to emphasize their own expertise. The point is, you can‚Äôt trust ‚Äôem. I can‚Äôt really say I‚Äôm that much different‚Ä¶ My [Front End Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/vinceaggrippino/legacy-front-end) from freeCodeCamp is the only "education" item I can list on my r√©sum√©. It‚Äô would benefit me greatly to convince people that my certification is very valueable, but I guess my honesty is my downfall. In this digital age, that certificate alone isn‚Äôt even worth the paper it‚Äôs not printed on‚Ä¶ And, wouldn‚Äôt you know it, I‚Äôm unemployed.
<p>When you apply for a job, the employer‚Äôs only questions are &quot;Can this person do the job?&quot; and then &quot;How well?&quot;. Education doesn‚Äôt even really matter, but, chances are, the first person to look at the stack of r√©sum√©s isn‚Äôt going to be the technical manager, but a hiring manager. They might not be intimately familiar with the job you‚Äôre applying for, but they know the posted requirements‚Ä¶ <em>x degree</em>, <em>y years of experience</em>, <em>skills a, b, &amp; c</em>.</p>
<p>Since there‚Äôs been a lot of popular commentary downplaying the value of traditional education, your application won‚Äôt necessarily be deleted without the degree, but a degree holder (even in an unrelated field) will still be considered before anyone with only a certification‚Ä¶ Someone with more experience will always be considered before someone with just a certification‚Ä¶ Someone with demonstrated skills will always be considered before someone who picked up their skills earning a certification‚Ä¶ Do you see the pattern? It is <em>only</em> when all other things are equal that a certification will be a benefit.</p>
<p>If your r√©sum√© does make it to the technical manager then the priorities are rearranged a bit. At this point, degree and certification are meaningless. It‚Äôs all about skills and the experience applying those skills. This is the critical stage, and this is where &quot;it depends&quot; comes in. Projects built while earning a certification can effectively demonstrate your skills, but not the certification itself.</p>
<p>And this is the moral of the story‚Ä¶ A certification program can be a great tool for picking up new skills, but it‚Äôs only in the application of these skills that we become valuable to employers. If traditional education is an option, consider it carefully, but the rest of us need to focus on building our r√©sum√©, not collecting certifications, long before we start the application process. Even if you‚Äôre building projects to earn a certification, make ‚Äôem good because you may want to show them on your r√©sum√© some day.</p>

        <p>Online courses all seem to share one flaw‚Ä¶ To put it bluntly, they piss me off‚Ä¶ Inconsistent information, outdated materials, poor explanation of key concepts, and, sometimes, patently incorrect information. But if I stop to think about it for a moment, it‚Äôs actually a feature.</p>
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown">I‚Äôve taken advantage of **a lot** of online curriculum. I‚Äôve been active at freeCodeCamp, Udemy, Udacity, [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/vaggrippino), [Code School](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/vince-aggrippino), Coursera, [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/vaggrippino/), and edX, just to name a few.
<p>I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve typed a long, angry tirade about inconsistencies or impossible questions only to delete the whole thing as soon as I calm down. (Well, a few might have been submitted üò≥)</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a problem, but it‚Äôs really a feature. If we coast through a course from beginning to end without ever needing another site, it might result in a smoother experience, but we wouldn‚Äôt learn much. It doesn‚Äôt matter how good the course is. We <em>need</em> other perspectives or more detailed information from multiple sources. More importantly, we need to learn <em>how</em> to find information without a guide. And, especially in IT, we need to be very good at sorting out conflicting information and correcting errors in code and documentation. Without these supporting skills, the learned skill can‚Äôt be effectively applied on the job.</p>

        <p>You‚Äôre watching YouTube when you see a strange video entitled ‚ÄúNo matter what, the work stays on!‚Äù ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>The scene opens to a large set of balance scales resting on a low platform. A man puts a big shiny metal weight embossed with the word ‚Äúwork‚Äù on the left side of the scales. Next to it, he puts another weight. This one is marked ‚Äúlearning‚Äù.</p>
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown">On the right side, he starts placing roughly formed gray cement bricks. One at a time, brick after brick, and the right side soon outweighs the left. He keeps going, and we see that each brick is engraved with a different word. The first one says "daughter". Then "wife"‚Ä¶ More bricks‚Ä¶ "house"‚Ä¶ "diet"‚Ä¶ As he continues, you notice that the condition of each brick is worse than the last. Only the first one, "daughter", appears to have been handled carefully. The rest are dirty and broken‚Ä¶ "health"‚Ä¶ "exercise"‚Ä¶ The scale starts to overbalance and nearly falls over. You hear the man curse under his breath as he steps on the base of the scale to keep it from falling over‚Ä¶ "pain"‚Ä¶ and finally‚Ä¶ "sleep".
<p>At first, the weights for &quot;learning&quot; and &quot;work&quot; seemed heavy, but now they look small by comparison to the stack of bricks. Somehow, though, he‚Äôs keeping everything in place. He seems satisfied with his work.</p>
<p>Just as he‚Äôs appraising his efforts, a large cinder block flies through the air and strikes the man in the back of the head! He falls forward, knocking over the scales along with all the bricks and the metal weights.</p>
<p>With blood oozing from a wound at the back of his head, you wonder if he‚Äôs dead, but he stirs. Disoriented and confused, he stands and looks at the cinder block with disgust. Then he proceeds to set up the scales again. First placing the metal weights, then each brick just as before. Finally, he picks up the cinder block and, placing both feet on the base of the scale, he carefully balances it on top of the other bricks. Now we can see what‚Äôs engraved in the side of the cinder block‚Ä¶ &quot;mental health&quot;.</p>
<p>Our protagonist, sweating, bloody, and exhausted, glances up at the &quot;work&quot; and &quot;learning&quot; weights before looking directly at the camera and, flashing his best winning smile, gives a <em>thumbs up</em> before the scene fades to black.</p>
<p>&quot;That was weird.&quot; you say out loud before clicking <em>thumbs down</em>. Then you click on a &quot;related&quot; video about work / life balance from someone who quit their job to be a full-time <em>YouTuber</em>. &quot;He must know what he‚Äôs talking about.&quot; you think to yourself‚Ä¶ &quot;He has over 100,000 subscribers!&quot;</p>

        <p>What am I supposed to put in my portfolio? Ideally, I‚Äôd have several projects that I built while learning as well as links to past employers‚Äô websites that I contributed to. I should also have some testimonials from people I‚Äôve worked with in the past, but I don‚Äôt have any of this.</p>
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown">My professional history is too far in the past. My previous employers have either been bought / merged / closed or have moved far past my contributions.
<p>What I do have is over 175 <em>pens</em> <a href="https://codepen.io/VAggrippino/">at CodePen.io</a>, 27 repositories <a href="https://github.com/VAggrippino">at GitHub</a>, and 17 &quot;projects&quot; I completed for freeCodeCamp. None of this is professional-quality code worthy of a portfolio.</p>
<p>In short, everything I‚Äôve ever done to show my skills or experience is either gone or an embarassment, and that makes it difficult to actively look for work right now.</p>
<p>This is very disheartening‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been working with computers professionally since 1990 and focused on Web Development since 2001, but I‚Äôve got nothing to show for it.</p>
<p>Nothing right now, at least‚Ä¶</p>
<p>To quote the mantra of the excellent <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/">Shop Talk Show podcast</a> &quot;Just Build Websites!&quot; In that vein, I‚Äôve got some ideas for sites to build for the sole purpose of putting them in my portfolio. My first portfolio project, <a href="https://github.com/VAggrippino/findIt">a search engine</a>, is in progress.</p>

        <p>Years ago, I proudly applied the <abbr title="Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP">LAMP</abbr> stack to all of my web development efforts. Never mind that it was smack dab in the middle of the time when PHP deserved its bad reputation and most, if not all, of the code that I <g class="gr_ gr_53 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" data-gr-id="53" id="53">wrote</g> was as bad as the worst out there. I was making money. I was confident, working steadily, and proud of my work.</p>
<p>Times have changed. I took some time off from working and quite literally forgot everything I knew about Web Development. It was time to do some retraining.</p>
<p>One logical perspective suggests that it would‚Äôve been best to jump back into the PHP ecosystem. If I read some tutorials I might <em>*revive*</em> some of the connections that made me enjoy being a PHP developer. There are many employment opportunities for PHP Developers and PHP has come a long way since the bad old days. It‚Äôs much easier to write good code in PHP and there are powerful frameworks like Symfony and Laravel that put Web Development with PHP on par with other contemporary methodologies. But I didn‚Äôt take this route. I felt like I needed something new to spark my imagination again.</p>
<p>There were a few things poking at my enthusiasm (<em>Wake up!‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre <a href="https://youtu.be/uBxMPqxJGqI">not dead yet</a>‚Ä¶</em>). First of all, I remembered having fun with jQuery. It was mostly frontend animated stuff. I definitely wanted to have fun again. CSS animation was the next thing to have captured my imagination. I didn‚Äôt know how to do it, but I knew that it was a thing and I wanted to know more. Finally, there‚Äôs <g class="gr_ gr_32 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" data-gr-id="32" id="32">Node</g>. I knew almost nothing about it, but I had heard that it allowed server-side development using JavaScript.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs how it all connected in my mind‚Ä¶</p>
<p>jQuery == JavaScript == animation == fun<br>
‚à¥ JavaScript == fun &amp;&amp; animation == fun<br>
‚à¥ CSS animation == fun<br>
‚à¥ Node == fun</p>
<p>It was about this time that I (re-)discovered <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a>, which guides the learner through a Web Development stack using jQuery, React, &amp; NodeJS. So, freeCodeCamp‚Äôs curriculum was perfectly aligned with my interests and goals.</p>
<p>Some time has passed since then. I‚Äôve followed freeCodeCamp‚Äôs curriculum pretty closely, but I used many other resources too. I still have a lot to learn, but I‚Äôd consider myself a competent <abbr title="Mongo, Express, React, Node">MERN</abbr> stack developer. Given all the information I‚Äôve gleaned from forums, social media, and job search sites, I‚Äôm confident that I‚Äôve chosen the right path for me.</p>
<p>This isn‚Äôt to say that I‚Äôve completely abandoned the LAMP stack. On the contrary, I‚Äôm looking forward to jumping back in. I definitely plan to present both LAMP and MERN skills among my service offerings.</p>
<p>I have to give credit for my current Web Development focus <g class="gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" data-gr-id="9" id="9">to</g> my past experience with jQuery. Ironically, I don‚Äôt have much use for jQuery these days. Anything I ever did with jQuery can be done using a combination of plain JavaScript and CSS, without the overhead of external libraries.</p>
<p>So‚Ä¶ What‚Äôs your stack? And why?</p>

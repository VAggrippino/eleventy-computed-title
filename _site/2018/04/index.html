        <p>I‚Äôm losing my momentum. That <em>new project</em> enthusiasm is gone and I‚Äôm faced with distraction and doubt. What do I do? Choose an easier alternative? Prepare more before continuing? Or push forward at a unique and considerable risk?</p>
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown">The greatest barrier to my employment right now is the lack of a good portfolio. With this in mind, I put together a list of projects to build that I think will demonstrate the full range of my skills‚Ä¶ Copies of existing sites with unique modifications‚Ä¶ Re-creations of old sites with my own perspective on how they should be built today‚Ä¶ And, some original ideas. These are all high-quality, broadly scoped projects targeting real use cases. They are *not* quick one or two day jobs.
<p>About three weeks ago, I chose one from the list and started work. Now I‚Äôm at a critical stage. There are, of course, implementation challenges, but that was expected. The problem is that it‚Äôs not a new project any more. I‚Äôm fixing bugs more than I‚Äôm adding features and I‚Äôm caught under the avalanche of minutiae of making it <em>just right</em>. It has become a grind: <em>feature‚Ä¶ bug‚Ä¶ bug‚Ä¶ bug‚Ä¶ feature‚Ä¶ bug‚Ä¶ bug‚Ä¶</em> and so on. I‚Äôm tired. I don‚Äôt look forward to working on it any more. I find my mind wandering. I‚Äôm prone to distraction and doubt. Seemingly on it‚Äôs own, My mind is tempting me with alternatives‚Ä¶ <em>Maybe I should work on my r√©sum√© instead.</em> ‚Ä¶ <em>Maybe I should work on my blog instead.</em> ‚Ä¶ <em>Maybe I should do some Upwork projects instead.</em> ‚Ä¶ <em>Maybe I should read more about creating a portfolio first.</em> ‚Ä¶</p>
<p><em>This</em> is a critical time. I know all too well that this happens in any project that takes more than a couple of days to finish.</p>
<p>Admittedly, my mental stamina is quite low. It‚Äôs my own fault, but at the same time I feel like it was completely out of my control.</p>
<p>For several years after I got out of the Army, I coasted. I did quite well for myself. I had no focus at all, but I had endless energy and boundless enthusiasm. Then I got sick. My energy disappeared and my enthusiasm turned to fear. My constant worry that I would trigger another <em>episode</em> taught me to <em>back off</em> whenever I felt stress. I got very good at <em>backing off</em> and lost the ability to <em>follow through</em>.</p>
<p>Then, my daughter started speaking and dreaming and wanting things beyond simple candy and toys. She has dreams and goals of her own now. What kind of example do I set if I stop working whenever my initial enthusiasm wears off. What kind of parent am I if I don‚Äôt earn an income to provide her with a decent education or an environment where her imagination can flourish and she can achieve her goals?</p>
<p>No! I will not <em>back off</em>! This is the mental equivalent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_to_failure">muscle failure</a> and I must push in order to grow. This is an essential trial and I must not fail if I want to ‚Ä¶ be a person again.</p>

        <p>There are many published opinions on the value of IT certifications when you‚Äôre looking for a job. If you do a web search, you‚Äôll find ‚Äôem. They range from ‚Äúit depends on the certification‚Äù to ‚Äúthey‚Äôre absolutely essential‚Äù. Well, I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb here and say that certifications are nearly worthless.</p>
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown">Those who write about IT certification usually have something at stake. Either there‚Äôs a financial incentive or they want to emphasize their own expertise. The point is, you can‚Äôt trust ‚Äôem. I can‚Äôt really say I‚Äôm that much different‚Ä¶ My [Front End Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/vinceaggrippino/legacy-front-end) from freeCodeCamp is the only "education" item I can list on my r√©sum√©. It‚Äô would benefit me greatly to convince people that my certification is very valueable, but I guess my honesty is my downfall. In this digital age, that certificate alone isn‚Äôt even worth the paper it‚Äôs not printed on‚Ä¶ And, wouldn‚Äôt you know it, I‚Äôm unemployed.
<p>When you apply for a job, the employer‚Äôs only questions are &quot;Can this person do the job?&quot; and then &quot;How well?&quot;. Education doesn‚Äôt even really matter, but, chances are, the first person to look at the stack of r√©sum√©s isn‚Äôt going to be the technical manager, but a hiring manager. They might not be intimately familiar with the job you‚Äôre applying for, but they know the posted requirements‚Ä¶ <em>x degree</em>, <em>y years of experience</em>, <em>skills a, b, &amp; c</em>.</p>
<p>Since there‚Äôs been a lot of popular commentary downplaying the value of traditional education, your application won‚Äôt necessarily be deleted without the degree, but a degree holder (even in an unrelated field) will still be considered before anyone with only a certification‚Ä¶ Someone with more experience will always be considered before someone with just a certification‚Ä¶ Someone with demonstrated skills will always be considered before someone who picked up their skills earning a certification‚Ä¶ Do you see the pattern? It is <em>only</em> when all other things are equal that a certification will be a benefit.</p>
<p>If your r√©sum√© does make it to the technical manager then the priorities are rearranged a bit. At this point, degree and certification are meaningless. It‚Äôs all about skills and the experience applying those skills. This is the critical stage, and this is where &quot;it depends&quot; comes in. Projects built while earning a certification can effectively demonstrate your skills, but not the certification itself.</p>
<p>And this is the moral of the story‚Ä¶ A certification program can be a great tool for picking up new skills, but it‚Äôs only in the application of these skills that we become valuable to employers. If traditional education is an option, consider it carefully, but the rest of us need to focus on building our r√©sum√©, not collecting certifications, long before we start the application process. Even if you‚Äôre building projects to earn a certification, make ‚Äôem good because you may want to show them on your r√©sum√© some day.</p>

        <p>Online courses all seem to share one flaw‚Ä¶ To put it bluntly, they piss me off‚Ä¶ Inconsistent information, outdated materials, poor explanation of key concepts, and, sometimes, patently incorrect information. But if I stop to think about it for a moment, it‚Äôs actually a feature.</p>
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown">I‚Äôve taken advantage of **a lot** of online curriculum. I‚Äôve been active at freeCodeCamp, Udemy, Udacity, [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/vaggrippino), [Code School](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/vince-aggrippino), Coursera, [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/vaggrippino/), and edX, just to name a few.
<p>I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve typed a long, angry tirade about inconsistencies or impossible questions only to delete the whole thing as soon as I calm down. (Well, a few might have been submitted üò≥)</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a problem, but it‚Äôs really a feature. If we coast through a course from beginning to end without ever needing another site, it might result in a smoother experience, but we wouldn‚Äôt learn much. It doesn‚Äôt matter how good the course is. We <em>need</em> other perspectives or more detailed information from multiple sources. More importantly, we need to learn <em>how</em> to find information without a guide. And, especially in IT, we need to be very good at sorting out conflicting information and correcting errors in code and documentation. Without these supporting skills, the learned skill can‚Äôt be effectively applied on the job.</p>

        <p>You‚Äôre watching YouTube when you see a strange video entitled ‚ÄúNo matter what, the work stays on!‚Äù ‚Ä¶</p>
<p>The scene opens to a large set of balance scales resting on a low platform. A man puts a big shiny metal weight embossed with the word ‚Äúwork‚Äù on the left side of the scales. Next to it, he puts another weight. This one is marked ‚Äúlearning‚Äù.</p>
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown">On the right side, he starts placing roughly formed gray cement bricks. One at a time, brick after brick, and the right side soon outweighs the left. He keeps going, and we see that each brick is engraved with a different word. The first one says "daughter". Then "wife"‚Ä¶ More bricks‚Ä¶ "house"‚Ä¶ "diet"‚Ä¶ As he continues, you notice that the condition of each brick is worse than the last. Only the first one, "daughter", appears to have been handled carefully. The rest are dirty and broken‚Ä¶ "health"‚Ä¶ "exercise"‚Ä¶ The scale starts to overbalance and nearly falls over. You hear the man curse under his breath as he steps on the base of the scale to keep it from falling over‚Ä¶ "pain"‚Ä¶ and finally‚Ä¶ "sleep".
<p>At first, the weights for &quot;learning&quot; and &quot;work&quot; seemed heavy, but now they look small by comparison to the stack of bricks. Somehow, though, he‚Äôs keeping everything in place. He seems satisfied with his work.</p>
<p>Just as he‚Äôs appraising his efforts, a large cinder block flies through the air and strikes the man in the back of the head! He falls forward, knocking over the scales along with all the bricks and the metal weights.</p>
<p>With blood oozing from a wound at the back of his head, you wonder if he‚Äôs dead, but he stirs. Disoriented and confused, he stands and looks at the cinder block with disgust. Then he proceeds to set up the scales again. First placing the metal weights, then each brick just as before. Finally, he picks up the cinder block and, placing both feet on the base of the scale, he carefully balances it on top of the other bricks. Now we can see what‚Äôs engraved in the side of the cinder block‚Ä¶ &quot;mental health&quot;.</p>
<p>Our protagonist, sweating, bloody, and exhausted, glances up at the &quot;work&quot; and &quot;learning&quot; weights before looking directly at the camera and, flashing his best winning smile, gives a <em>thumbs up</em> before the scene fades to black.</p>
<p>&quot;That was weird.&quot; you say out loud before clicking <em>thumbs down</em>. Then you click on a &quot;related&quot; video about work / life balance from someone who quit their job to be a full-time <em>YouTuber</em>. &quot;He must know what he‚Äôs talking about.&quot; you think to yourself‚Ä¶ &quot;He has over 100,000 subscribers!&quot;</p>

        <p>What am I supposed to put in my portfolio? Ideally, I‚Äôd have several projects that I built while learning as well as links to past employers‚Äô websites that I contributed to. I should also have some testimonials from people I‚Äôve worked with in the past, but I don‚Äôt have any of this.</p>
<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown">My professional history is too far in the past. My previous employers have either been bought / merged / closed or have moved far past my contributions.
<p>What I do have is over 175 <em>pens</em> <a href="https://codepen.io/VAggrippino/">at CodePen.io</a>, 27 repositories <a href="https://github.com/VAggrippino">at GitHub</a>, and 17 &quot;projects&quot; I completed for freeCodeCamp. None of this is professional-quality code worthy of a portfolio.</p>
<p>In short, everything I‚Äôve ever done to show my skills or experience is either gone or an embarassment, and that makes it difficult to actively look for work right now.</p>
<p>This is very disheartening‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been working with computers professionally since 1990 and focused on Web Development since 2001, but I‚Äôve got nothing to show for it.</p>
<p>Nothing right now, at least‚Ä¶</p>
<p>To quote the mantra of the excellent <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/">Shop Talk Show podcast</a> &quot;Just Build Websites!&quot; In that vein, I‚Äôve got some ideas for sites to build for the sole purpose of putting them in my portfolio. My first portfolio project, <a href="https://github.com/VAggrippino/findIt">a search engine</a>, is in progress.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm working on a page that displays thumbnail images. When I click on a thumbnail I want it to show an <g class="gr_ gr_27 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" data-gr-id="27" id="27">info box</g> containing more image details. I‚Äôm using a CSS transition on the <g class="gr_ gr_28 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" data-gr-id="28" id="28">info box</g> and I want to populate the image details while the <g class="gr_ gr_29 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" data-gr-id="29" id="29">info box</g> is hidden. If the <g class="gr_ gr_30 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" data-gr-id="30" id="30">info box</g> is already visible from clicking on a different thumbnail, I need to hide it first and populate the image details after the transition completes.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs some pseudocode that shows what I want to happen‚Ä¶</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">thumbnail.addEventListener('click', e =&gt; {
  if (infoBox.isVisible()) {
    // hide the info box (CSS transition)
    // after the transition ends, populate the image details
  } else {
    // populate the image details immediately
  }

  // show the info box (CSS transition)
})
</code></pre>
<p>The browser triggers a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/transitionend_event"><code>transitionend</code> event</a> when a transition finishes, but it‚Äôs not fired at all if the info box is already hidden. A function that hides the element and returns a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises">Promise</a> would be ideal. The Promise would be resolved after the transition completed or immediately if theinfo box was already hidden, but I don‚Äôt use JavaScript to hide or show an element. I typically just toggle a <code>hidden</code> class and let the CSS animation do the work, so we can‚Äôt determine when the animation has completed.</p>
<p>I can‚Äôt just return a Promise from the event handler for <code>transitionend</code> because I don‚Äôt call the event handler. I just pass it as an argument to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener"><code>addEventListener()</code></a> and the browser calls it. But there‚Äôs always a way‚Ä¶</p>
<p>I searched for <em>promises for CSS transition events</em>, but the higher ranking search result has a <strong>fatal flaw</strong>. In a <em>pen</em>1 entitled ‚ÄúCSS Transition End with a Promise‚Äù, a Promise <em>is</em> resolved when the transition completes, but <strong>the event handler is never removed from the element</strong>. The code attempts to remove the handler, but <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/removeEventListener"><code>removeEventListener()</code></a> is passed a function that wasn‚Äôt attached as the event handler. <strong>The actual event handler is an anonymous function</strong> that calls the function which the author tries to remove. If you use this code it could eventually cause a problem (What kind of problem? How soon? ‚Ä¶ this needs testing) as new event handlers are infinitely attached to the element.</p>
<p>I found a good solution on my second attempt at <a href="https://gist.github.com/davej/44e3bbec414ed4665220">this <em>Gist</em></a>). The trick is a function that returns a Promise and makes a CSS (or CSS class) change that causes a transition, then immediately attaches an event handler for the <code>transitionend</code> event in which it removes itself and resolves the promise.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs my demo inspired by the Gist:</p>
<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="pVgjjj" data-user="VAggrippino" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

        <p>Years ago, I proudly applied the <abbr title="Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP">LAMP</abbr> stack to all of my web development efforts. Never mind that it was smack dab in the middle of the time when PHP deserved its bad reputation and most, if not all, of the code that I <g class="gr_ gr_53 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" data-gr-id="53" id="53">wrote</g> was as bad as the worst out there. I was making money. I was confident, working steadily, and proud of my work.</p>
<p>Times have changed. I took some time off from working and quite literally forgot everything I knew about Web Development. It was time to do some retraining.</p>
<p>One logical perspective suggests that it would‚Äôve been best to jump back into the PHP ecosystem. If I read some tutorials I might <em>*revive*</em> some of the connections that made me enjoy being a PHP developer. There are many employment opportunities for PHP Developers and PHP has come a long way since the bad old days. It‚Äôs much easier to write good code in PHP and there are powerful frameworks like Symfony and Laravel that put Web Development with PHP on par with other contemporary methodologies. But I didn‚Äôt take this route. I felt like I needed something new to spark my imagination again.</p>
<p>There were a few things poking at my enthusiasm (<em>Wake up!‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre <a href="https://youtu.be/uBxMPqxJGqI">not dead yet</a>‚Ä¶</em>). First of all, I remembered having fun with jQuery. It was mostly frontend animated stuff. I definitely wanted to have fun again. CSS animation was the next thing to have captured my imagination. I didn‚Äôt know how to do it, but I knew that it was a thing and I wanted to know more. Finally, there‚Äôs <g class="gr_ gr_32 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" data-gr-id="32" id="32">Node</g>. I knew almost nothing about it, but I had heard that it allowed server-side development using JavaScript.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs how it all connected in my mind‚Ä¶</p>
<p>jQuery == JavaScript == animation == fun<br>
‚à¥ JavaScript == fun &amp;&amp; animation == fun<br>
‚à¥ CSS animation == fun<br>
‚à¥ Node == fun</p>
<p>It was about this time that I (re-)discovered <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a>, which guides the learner through a Web Development stack using jQuery, React, &amp; NodeJS. So, freeCodeCamp‚Äôs curriculum was perfectly aligned with my interests and goals.</p>
<p>Some time has passed since then. I‚Äôve followed freeCodeCamp‚Äôs curriculum pretty closely, but I used many other resources too. I still have a lot to learn, but I‚Äôd consider myself a competent <abbr title="Mongo, Express, React, Node">MERN</abbr> stack developer. Given all the information I‚Äôve gleaned from forums, social media, and job search sites, I‚Äôm confident that I‚Äôve chosen the right path for me.</p>
<p>This isn‚Äôt to say that I‚Äôve completely abandoned the LAMP stack. On the contrary, I‚Äôm looking forward to jumping back in. I definitely plan to present both LAMP and MERN skills among my service offerings.</p>
<p>I have to give credit for my current Web Development focus <g class="gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" data-gr-id="9" id="9">to</g> my past experience with jQuery. Ironically, I don‚Äôt have much use for jQuery these days. Anything I ever did with jQuery can be done using a combination of plain JavaScript and CSS, without the overhead of external libraries.</p>
<p>So‚Ä¶ What‚Äôs your stack? And why?</p>

<div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown">Inspired by the consistent efforts of [some](https://steemit.com/@webgrrrl) [friends](https://steemit.com/@danieldoughty) and [an article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/every-developer-should-have-a-blog-heres-why-and-how-to-stick-with-it-5fd55a247fbf) at freeCodeCamp‚Äôs blog, I decided to start blogging again.
</div><div class="wp-block-jetpack-markdown">I‚Äôve been using GitHub to organize most of my recent efforts and I figured that blogging with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosting for free with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) would be an ideal solution. All I need to do is create a new project named *blog*, enable GitHub Pages, and start writing [Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) files. No PHP, no server, no database, no security or plugin updates‚Ä¶ perfect, right?
<p>It‚Äôs not that easy‚Ä¶</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We highly recommend installing Jekyll to preview your site and help troubleshoot failed Jekyll builds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They repeat this throughout <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll">GitHub‚Äôs documentation</a> and they really mean it. There‚Äôs no easy way to set up a Jekyll blog on GitHub Pages without either setting up Jekyll locally or forking an existing Jekyll blog.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jekyll is not officially supported for Windows. For more information, see ‚Äú<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/#installation">Jekyll on Windows</a>‚Äù in the official Jekyll documentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know, I know‚Ä¶ I shouldn‚Äôt be using Windows. I used to be a devoted Linux user and I called myself an Open Source Software enthusiast. Well, I forgot. It‚Äôs a thing I‚Äôm not going to get into right now, but when I started to think again the computer in front of me had Windows on it. This is currently my only option.</p>
<p>I did the reading. This setup requires Jekyll on Ruby on Bash on Ubuntu on Windows and every step of the process comes with vague warnings about <em>issues</em>. Even if I manage to bypass any issues, I have to set up and maintain Ruby on Windows, learn how to use the Gem package manager, setup and maintain Bash on Ubuntu on Windows, learn YAML, and learn the Liquid Templating Engine.</p>
<p>Enough is enough! Damn GitHub Pages and Damn Jekyll! What happened to just writing my thoughts in markdown?! I‚Äôm busy learning more important things right now. I‚Äôm just about ready to throw in the towel and become dependent on WordPress again. One last try‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll look for a tutorial.</p>
<p>I found what I needed; An excellent article at Smashing Magazine entitled ‚Äú<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/">Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages</a>‚Äù promises to tell me exactly how to set up my own blog with Jekyll and host it with GitHub Pages. That sounds perfect! It is just a little bit misleading, though. The article doesn‚Äôt actually tell me how to set up my own blog. It tells me how to fork the author‚Äôs blog boilerplate and change some variables to show my information instead of his.</p>
<p>You know what‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt care. It got the job done and now I have a Jekyll-driven blog. For now, I can post my thoughts and share them however I want to. When I decide to <em>upgrade</em>, either by learning and building Jekyll locally or by diving back into the WordPress ecosystem, I‚Äôll have very little difficulty. My markdown files can very easily be copied over or imported into any system I choose.</p>

<p>Today was the first day of the free weekend for the the real World Vue course from Vue Mastery.</p>
<p>Recently, I’ve been focused on ReactJS, but I also worked over a year for a company that used Vue exclusively. I’m a proponent of the idea that IT workers should maintain a narrow skill set focus, but I make this exception because I don’t want to remove Vue from my résumé. Besides that, it’s an opportunity to get a course for free that I wouldn’t otherwise pay for.</p>
<p>My time today was limited by medical issues and treatment, but I still managed to get in some time with the Vue course.</p>
<p>I covered the first two lessons and part of the third. I learned about <abbr title="Hot Module Replacement">HMR</abbr> which sounds a lot like <em>live reload</em>. A little extra research tells me this is not actually a feature of Vue, but of <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a>.</p>
<p>I also learned how to use the Vue CLI, the structure of the default app created with <code>vue create &lt;app name&gt;</code> or its web-based graphical alternative, <code>vue ui</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, I started learning about <em>Single File Components</em>, Vue’s method of keeping all the parts of a component in a single file. Scoped CSS is kind of interesting. A little extra research tells me that this was actually part of HTML and supported by Firefox for quite a while and with a flag on one version of Google Chrome, but has now been removed. Vue is essentially providing a polyfill for this feature.</p>

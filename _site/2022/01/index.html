<p>When I was in the Army, I was a cross-country runner. I was pretty good at it. I’d get my second wind quickly and then I felt like I could actually run at a good pace forever. I considered running competitively and even started looking for marathons outside of the Army. But when my knee started hurting I stopped running. I didn’t realize that athletes consider pain to be an integral part of their sport. Hell, I never felt like a <em>real</em> athlete anyway. My knee <em>still</em> hurts all the time, but I often wonder what I missed.</p>
<p>Now, I’m a Web Developer. A <a href="https://www.aggrippino.com/one-armed-programming/">while ago</a>, I started to feel pain in my hand. It got bad and then, even after corrective surgery, it got much worse. So, I stopped working… stopped doing anything, really, just because my hand hurts… WTF!? Didn’t I already learn this lesson?!</p>
<p>I never anticipated the intense chronic pain, but that doesn’t matter. It’s a stupid excuse for neglecting my work and my hobby and most of what I do for fun. I can <em>still use</em> my hand and it’ll hurt no matter what I do. So… less Netflix, YouTube, and FMovies… More HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue, etc…</p>
<p>I might not be as productive as I’d like, especially with the pain and impending <s>doom</s> spine surgery, but that’s no excuse to do nothing.</p>
<p>… To be continued…</p>

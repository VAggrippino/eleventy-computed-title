That‚Äôs no longer true. I have Cubital Tunnel Syndrome.
<p>Cubital Tunnel Syndrome affects the ring- and little- fingers and the severity can range from some slight tingling to extreme pain and near paralysis of these fingers. Unfortunately, I have the most severe symptoms and it got this bad in under 2 months.</p>
<p>This is a relatively common problem and the corrective surgery is scheduled. I thought it would be fine. I‚Äôd take some time off of work and be right back at it. Then I learned that full recovery takes up to 3 months. Screw that! I‚Äôd go insane (again)!</p>
<p>So, my next challenge begins now and is dedicated to becoming somewhat productive with only one arm.</p>

<p>Today I spent some time coming up with <a href="https://codepen.io/VAggrippino/pen/BaZayxw">a possible solution</a> for another 100DaysOfCoder‚Äôs CSS problem‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure if that counts towards my 100DaysOfCode effort or not.</p>
<p>Then I jumped back into the Modern React with Redux course. This is good for me. I enjoyed my brief detour into Vue, but I think I prefer the React ecosystem, community, and career opportunities.</p>
<p>Lessons 39 ‚Äì 48<br>
I learned more about reusable components and created a reusable component that could be used to contain a component I had already created.</p>
<p>I completed some exercises to demonstrate my understanding of basic props as well as <code>props.children</code> for nested content.</p>
<p>There was some discussion and comparison of class-based vs functional components. This course is taking the approach that it‚Äôll be easier to understand React hooks if we learn class based components and lifecycle methods first.</p>
<p>I also spent a little time figuring out <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">yarn</a>. Apparently <code>create-react-app</code> assumes yarn is your preference if it‚Äôs installed. Even if you‚Äôve only installed it out of curiosity üòÖ</p>

<p>I made up for the slow progress of the last few days today and finished the Real World Vue course at vuemastery.com:</p>
<h2>Lesson 3: Single File Components</h2>
<p>I finished up lesson three by finishing the exercise for building an <abbr title="Single File Components">SFC</abbr>.</p>
<h2>Lesson 4: Vue Router Essentials</h2>
<ul>
<li>Goes into detail about Client-Side Routing</li>
<li>Most of the work here is done inside of <code>router/index.js</code></li>
<li>I built an example of changing a route and there was some discussion of route-level code splitting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lesson 5: API Calls with Axios</h2>
<ul>
<li>Basic discussion of making API calls</li>
<li>Example of doing API requests using Axios</li>
<li>Covered refactoring to avoid redundant instances of Axios</li>
<li>Demonstration of services using Axios with an explanation I didn‚Äôt understand
<ul>
<li>Is ‚Äúservices‚Äù a special thing, or is it just a convention to put a reusable function like this into a directory named ‚Äúservices‚Äù.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lesson 6: Dynamic Routing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added a dynamic value to a route link and passed it via a property</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lesson 7: Deploying with Render</h2>
<ul>
<li>Learning about building a Vue app for production</li>
<li><code>npm run build</code>, which runs <code>vue-cli-service build</code></li>
<li>Enabling redirects at hosting provider to support Vue‚Äôs client-side routing with history mode enabled.
<ul>
<li>Covered lack of 404 pages when enabling these redirects</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lesson 8: Scaling the app</h2>
<p>ü§ë<strong>Upsell!!</strong><br>
There‚Äôs nothing here about scaling Vue apps. This ‚Äúlesson‚Äù just discusses the other courses available at Vue Mastery.</p>
<h2>The End</h2>

What they offered for this free weekend wasn‚Äôt much. If this is representative of their curriculum, it‚Äôs not worth paying for. There‚Äôs better stuff on YouTube.

<p>Today was the first day of the free weekend for the the real World Vue course from Vue Mastery.</p>
<p>Recently, I‚Äôve been focused on ReactJS, but I also worked over a year for a company that used Vue exclusively. I‚Äôm a proponent of the idea that IT workers should maintain a narrow skill set focus, but I make this exception because I don‚Äôt want to remove Vue from my r√©sum√©. Besides that, it‚Äôs an opportunity to get a course for free that I wouldn‚Äôt otherwise pay for.</p>
<p>My time today was limited by medical issues and treatment, but I still managed to get in some time with the Vue course.</p>
<p>I covered the first two lessons and part of the third. I learned about <abbr title="Hot Module Replacement">HMR</abbr> which sounds a lot like <em>live reload</em>. A little extra research tells me this is not actually a feature of Vue, but of <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a>.</p>
<p>I also learned how to use the Vue CLI, the structure of the default app created with <code>vue create &lt;app name&gt;</code> or its web-based graphical alternative, <code>vue ui</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, I started learning about <em>Single File Components</em>, Vue‚Äôs method of keeping all the parts of a component in a single file. Scoped CSS is kind of interesting. A little extra research tells me that this was actually part of HTML and supported by Firefox for quite a while and with a flag on one version of Google Chrome, but has now been removed. Vue is essentially providing a polyfill for this feature.</p>

<p>In terms of actually sitting in front of the computer and coding, it was a light day today. Some essential, but unfortunately timed, medical appointments clashed with my US EST work schedule, but I was still able to review some materials from <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/">Modern React with Redux</a> while on the road and I did a little bit of coding after recovering from lost sleep. I experimented a little with React props and nested components.</p>
